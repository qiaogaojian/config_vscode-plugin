# Original

Create your custom macros by adding them to your `settings.json` (Code|File > Preferences > User Settings)

For example:

```json
"macros.list": {
    "commentDown": [
        "editor.action.copyLinesDownAction",
        "cursorUp",
        "editor.action.addCommentLine",
        "cursorDown"
    ]
}
```

This macro creates a copy of the current line, comments out the original line, and moves the cursor down to the copy.

Your macros can run any built-in VS Code action, and even actions from other extensions.
To see all the names of possible actions VS Code can run, see `Default Keyboard Shortcuts` (Code|File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts)

Give your macros names that briefly describe what they do.

> ## Add Keybindings to Run your Macros

in `keybindings.json` (Code|File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts) add bindings to your macros:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+cmd+/",
  "command": "macros.commentDown"
}
```

Notice that `macros.my_macro_name` has to match what you named your macro.

> ## Passing Arguments to Commands

Many commands accept arguments, like the "type" command which lets you insert text into the editor. For these cases use an object instead of a string when specifying the command to call in your `settings.json`:

```json
"macros.list": {
  "addSemicolon": [
    "cursorEnd",
      {"command": "type", "args": {"text": ";" }}
  ]
}
```

Reference of VScode commands that needs arguments can be found in [Built-in Commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands).
Note that simple-commands that can be found in the Keyboard Shortcuts list doesn't use argument : [Built-in Commands#simple-commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands#simple-commands).

> ## Executing Snippets As Part Of A Macro

Macros can also execute any of your snippets which is super neat. Just insert the same text that you would normally type for the snippet, followed by the `insertSnippet` command:

```json
"macros.list": {
  "doMySnippet": [
    {"command": "type", "args": {"text": "mySnippetPrefixHere" }},
    "insertSnippet"
  ]
}
```
