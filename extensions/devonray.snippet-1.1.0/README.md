## Import & Export (introduced in v1.0.0)

To import and export snippets, open the command panel (cmd + shift + p) on Mac, and search for import snippets or export snippets.

- When exporting it doesn't actually save a file to your machine, you will need to cmd + shift + s and choose a location to save.
- When importing you need to make sure its a valid json array and that the json object is correct, run an export to see an example.
