# Azure Account and Sign In



The Azure Account extension provides a single Azure sign in and subscription filtering experience for all other Azure extensions. It makes Azure's Cloud Shell service available in VS Code's integrated terminal.

## Signing In/Out

There are multiple commands accessible via the [command palette](https://aka.ms/AAephuz) that may be used to sign into Azure.

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell instances can be started via the terminal view in VS Code. To begin, click the
dropdown arrow in the terminal view and select from either `Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)` or
`Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell)`.

If this is your first time using the Cloud Shell, the following notification will appear prompting
you to set it up.

The Cloud Shell will load in the terminal view once you've finished configuring it.
