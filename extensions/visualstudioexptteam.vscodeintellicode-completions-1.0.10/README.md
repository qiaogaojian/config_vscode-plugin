# IntelliCode Completions

ðŸ›  **Visual Studio IntelliCode Completions** is an **experimental extension** which predicts up to a whole line of code based on your current context. Predictions appear as grey-text to the right of your cursor. This extension supports Python, with additional experimental support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

This extension may contain unstable, experimental code. The IntelliCode team is focused on iterating rapidly and new functionality will be added.

### How to use

Completions will appear after your cursor as you type, with a faded color. At any time, you can accept the suggestion by pressing the tab key. Additionally, you can dismiss any shown suggestion by pressing the ESC key.

Users' IntelliSense selection helps steer the model's prediction. When the IntelliSense window is open, pressing 'tab' once accepts the token selected in the InteliSense window, while a second 'tab' accepts the rest of the inline completion. 

To enable experimental support for JavaScript and TypeScript, search for intellicodeCompletions.language in the Settings menu.
